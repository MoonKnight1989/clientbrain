# Conversion-Focused Copywriting

A skill for writing web copy that converts — across landing pages, homepages, pricing pages, and product/feature pages.

## Core Principles

Every piece of copy must follow these rules. No exceptions.

### 1. Lead with Benefits, Not Features

Never describe what something *is*. Describe what it *does for the reader*.

**Bad:** "AI-powered knowledge management system with ontological indexing"
**Good:** "Get accurate answers from your company knowledge in seconds"

**Bad:** "4 professional microphones with lossless buffering"
**Good:** "Record crystal-clear audio with 4 professional mics featuring lossless buffering"

The feature can appear — but it follows the benefit, never leads.

### 2. Lead with Action Verbs

Headlines and subheadings start with verbs wherever possible. This creates momentum and makes the reader feel like they're already moving forward.

**Examples:**
- "Capture immersive spatial audio..."
- "Transform raw audio into professional sound..."
- "Stop losing knowledge when employees leave"
- "Turn scattered company knowledge into instant answers"

Avoid starting with nouns, adjectives, or "Our..." / "We..." / "The...".

### 3. Write for the Reader's Situation, Not the Product

Frame copy around the problem the reader recognises, then position the product as the resolution.

**Pattern:**
1. Name the pain or desire (what they're feeling right now)
2. Agitate briefly (what happens if they don't act)
3. Resolve with the product benefit (not the product itself)

### 4. Build Social Proof Into the Structure

Don't bolt social proof on as an afterthought. Weave credibility throughout:

- **Specificity over vagueness:** "Join 500+ teams" beats "Trusted by many"
- **Quantified results:** "Reduced response time by 60%" beats "Faster responses"
- **Named logos or recognisable signals** where available
- **Source-linked claims** — if you cite a stat, it should be verifiable

### 5. One CTA Per Context

Every section supports one primary action. Don't split attention. A secondary CTA is acceptable only if it serves a different stage of intent (e.g., "Start Free Trial" primary, "Book a Demo" secondary).

## Page-Specific Frameworks

### Landing Pages / Homepages

**Hero section structure:**
1. **Headline:** Benefit-led, action-verb opening. 6-12 words max.
2. **Subheading:** Expand on the headline with specifics — who it's for, what changes, how fast. 1-2 sentences.
3. **Primary CTA:** Clear, specific action. "Start Free Trial" not "Get Started". "Book a Call" not "Learn More".
4. **Trust bar:** Logos, stats, or a single credibility line immediately below.

**Section flow (recommended order):**
1. Hero (benefit + CTA)
2. Problem/pain statement (name what's broken)
3. How it works (3-step max, verb-led)
4. Use cases or personas (show the reader themselves)
5. Social proof (testimonials, stats, logos)
6. Objection handling (FAQ or inline)
7. Final CTA (repeat hero CTA with urgency or different angle)

**Homepage-specific rules:**
- Match the visitor's intent — if they arrive from an ad, confirm the ad's promise immediately
- Don't link out to unrelated pages from the hero; keep them in the conversion funnel
- Mobile-first: big buttons, scannable text, fast-loading images

### Pricing Pages

**Structure:**
1. **Page headline:** Benefit-led, not "Pricing" or "Our Plans". E.g., "The complete podcasting powerhouse in one package"
2. **Tier cards:** Each tier gets a one-line benefit summary (not a feature list title)
3. **Feature lists within tiers:** Lead each line with what the user gets to *do*, not what the feature *is*
4. **Ownership/commitment messaging:** State clearly and early — don't bury terms
5. **FAQ section:** Handle pricing objections directly (ROI, hidden costs, cancellation)

**Pricing copy rules:**
- Position the recommended tier visually and with language ("Most popular" or "Best value")
- Use specifics: "75GB cloud storage" not "Generous storage"
- If there's an all-in-one or ecosystem angle, sell the *complete system* feeling — not three separate products

### Product / Feature Pages

**Structure:**
1. **Hero:** What this product/feature lets the user achieve
2. **Key benefits:** 3-4 cards, each verb-led with a short supporting line
3. **Deep dive:** Expand on each benefit with context, use cases, or comparison
4. **Integration/compatibility:** How it fits their existing workflow
5. **CTA:** Tied to the logical next step for this product

**Rules:**
- Never open with the product name as the headline. Open with the outcome.
- Use comparisons to anchor value: "Makes [old way] feel like [negative comparison]"
- Technical specs go below the fold or in expandable sections — benefits always come first

## SEO & Readability Conventions

These rules apply to all web copy. They exist to ensure copy performs in search AND reads well for humans. When SEO and conversion conflict, conversion wins — but they rarely conflict if you follow these guidelines.

### Heading Hierarchy & Length

- **H1:** One per page only. 20-70 characters. Must contain the primary keyword naturally — never stuffed. This is your hero headline.
- **H2:** Section headings. 15-60 characters. Include secondary keywords where natural. These are your scannable page structure.
- **H3:** Subsection headings. 10-50 characters. Support H2 context. Use for feature breakdowns, FAQ questions, etc.
- **Never skip levels** (e.g., H1 → H3). Screen readers and search engines both rely on logical hierarchy.
- **Front-load keywords** in headings where possible without sacrificing the benefit-led principle. "Record studio-quality audio anywhere" beats "Anywhere recording with studio-quality audio" — the verb still leads, but the keyword appears naturally.

### Readability Standards

- **Target reading level:** Grade 7-9 (Flesch-Kincaid). This isn't dumbing down — it's clarity. Short sentences, common words, active voice.
- **Sentence length:** Average 15-20 words. Mix short punchy sentences (5-8 words) with longer ones for rhythm. Never exceed 30 words in a single sentence.
- **Paragraph length:** 1-3 sentences max for web copy. Single-sentence paragraphs are fine and often more impactful.
- **Use concrete language:** "Save 4 hours a week" not "Significantly reduce time spent". Specific beats vague for both readability and SEO.
- **Avoid passive voice** unless deliberately used for emphasis (rare).

### Meta & On-Page SEO Copy

- **Title tags:** 50-60 characters. Benefit-led, keyword-included. Format: "[Primary Benefit] | [Brand Name]" or "[Action Verb] [Keyword] — [Brand Name]"
- **Meta descriptions:** 140-155 characters. One clear benefit + a CTA or curiosity hook. These are ad copy for search results — write them like it.
- **URL slugs:** Short, keyword-rich, hyphen-separated. `/ai-knowledge-management` not `/our-amazing-new-ai-powered-knowledge-management-platform`

### Keyword Integration Rules

- **Primary keyword** appears in: H1, first 100 words of body copy, meta title, meta description.
- **Secondary keywords** appear in: H2s, body copy, image alt text.
- **Never sacrifice natural reading flow** for keyword placement. If it reads awkwardly, rewrite the sentence — don't force the keyword.
- **No keyword stuffing.** If a keyword appears more than once per 100 words, it's too many.
- **Use semantic variations** naturally — Google understands synonyms. "Record podcasts" / "podcast recording" / "capture audio" all reinforce the same topic.

### Structured Content for Featured Snippets

- **FAQ sections:** Use proper question-and-answer format. Keep answers to 40-60 words for snippet eligibility.
- **How-it-works sections:** Use numbered steps (3 max). These get pulled into featured snippets frequently.
- **Comparison/benefit lists:** If using bullet points in these sections, keep each to one clear statement.

## Copy Quality Checklist

Before finalising any copy, verify:

- [ ] Every headline starts with a verb or a clear benefit
- [ ] No section leads with a feature without framing the benefit first
- [ ] CTAs are specific actions, not vague ("Get Started" → "Start Free Trial")
- [ ] Social proof is quantified where possible
- [ ] Copy reads naturally aloud — no jargon unless the audience expects it
- [ ] Each section has a single clear purpose
- [ ] Objections are anticipated and addressed
- [ ] The reader can scan headings alone and understand the full value proposition
- [ ] H1 is unique, 20-70 chars, and contains the primary keyword
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is logical (H1 → H2 → H3, no skipped levels)
- [ ] Sentences average 15-20 words, none exceed 30
- [ ] Primary keyword appears in H1 and first 100 words naturally
- [ ] Meta title (50-60 chars) and meta description (140-155 chars) are included
- [ ] FAQ answers are 40-60 words (featured snippet eligible)

## Tone Guidelines

This skill is client-flexible. Do NOT default to a specific brand voice. Instead:

- **Ask** what the brand tone is, or infer from existing copy/site if provided
- **Default tone** (when no brand guidance exists): Clear, confident, direct. No fluff. No corporate jargon. Conversational but professional.
- **Always avoid:** Buzzwords without substance ("revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "best-in-class") unless backed by a specific claim. Passive voice. Hedging language ("might", "could potentially").

---

## Output Format

When generating copy, always present it in a structured, section-by-section format that maps to the page layout. Use clear section labels. Provide 2-3 options for headlines and CTAs so the user can choose.

**Example output structure:**

```
## Hero Section
**Headline Option 1:** [verb-led benefit headline]
**Headline Option 2:** [alternative angle]
**Subheading:** [1-2 sentence expansion]
**CTA:** [specific action button text]
**Trust bar:** [suggested credibility element]

## Section 2: Problem Statement
**Heading:** [pain-point framing]
**Body:** [2-3 sentences naming the problem]

[...continue per section]
```

When rewriting existing copy, show the original alongside the improved version with a brief note on what changed and why.
